Include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gn-math/assets/zones.json zones from an exrernal third party game source
'gn-math' with the zones.json organizing the games themeselves, for example:

{
    "id": 624,
    "name": "Happy Wheels",
    "cover": "{COVER_URL}/624.png",
    "url": "{HTML_URL}/624.html",
    "author": "Jim Bonacci",
    "authorLink": "https://totaljerkface.com/"
  },
  {
    "id": 625,
    "name": "Get Yoked",
    "cover": "{COVER_URL}/625.png",
    "url": "{HTML_URL}/625.html",
    "author": "gregs games",
    "authorLink": "https://gregs-games.itch.io/get-yoked-2"
  },
  {
    "id": 626,
    "name": "Doom 3",
    "cover": "{COVER_URL}/626.png",
    "url": "{HTML_URL}/626-f.html",
    "author": "id Software, 98corbins",
    "authorLink": "https://www.idsoftware.com",
    "special": [
      "port"
    ]
  },

  including finding the HTML_URL for the source of the site being https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gn-math/html@main/501.HTML_URL
  for example, when visiting that url with the code in the url slug it will visit the id combined with the
  zones.json source id's for the html url. 

  Include these games from this source to autopopulate on my website from my index.html, including the games from the files.

  also fix ascii title positioning to make it closer to the center, fix the background animation, and etc.
